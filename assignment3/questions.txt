- why do bullets remain on the game board after they hit the caterpillar?
- why do borders not reload after a bullet goes through them and instead leave
  an empty character after bullets pass?
- the next row and changing direction of the caterpillars makes sense, but does
  the line from the assignment 'note in the sample how they wrap around (tricky
  logic)' refer to direction change process or something else?
