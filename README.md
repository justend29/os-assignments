# Operating System Assignments

**assignment 1:** Basic job scheduler\
**assignment 2:** Shell supporting control sequences and piping\
**assignment 3:** Centipede terminal game, showcasing a custom thread-pool and a task abstraction for simpler concurrent programming\
**assignment 4:** FAT32 Image reader\
**jd-lib:** Is a small library that evolved throughout these assignments, full
of standard utilities, like generic containers and error handling mechanisms.

I'm most proud of assignment 2 and 3.
