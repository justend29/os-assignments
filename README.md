# Operating System Assignments

Contained are my assignments for Operating Systems 1. Certain programming
criteria and submission criteria were laid out that may seem odd. For example,
in assignment 3, linked-lists were mandatory, and each submission had to have
listing.txt file containing all the code. Nevertheless, I did my best to make
the code efficient, well organized, and contain proper error handling.

## Layout

**assignment 1:** Basic job scheduler\
**assignment 2:** Shell supporting control sequences and piping\
**assignment 3:** Centipede terminal game, showcasing a custom thread-pool and a task abstraction for simpler concurrent programming\
**assignment 4:** FAT32 Image reader\
**jd-lib:** Is a small library that evolved throughout these assignments, full
of standard utilities, like generic containers and error handling mechanisms.

I'm most proud of assignment 2 and 3.
